# Reference

> - **store**: React.js 프로젝트에서 사용하는 모든 동적 데이터들을 담아두는 곳 입니다.
> - **action**: 어떤 변화가 일어나야 할 지 나타내는 객체입니다.
> - **reducer**: action 객체를 받았을 때, 데이터를 어떻게 바꿀지 처리할지 정의하는 객체입니다.
## Install Dependencies
React.js 에서 Redux 를 사용 할 때, 두가지의 의존 모듈이 사용됩니다.
- **redux**
- **react-redux**: React.js 프로젝트에서 Redux 를 더 편하게 사용 할 수 있게 해줍니다.
```angular2
npm install --save redux react-redux
```
# Manual
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
